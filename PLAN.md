## 🔧 Technical Debt Tracking

### Current Debt Items
1. **Missing Dependencies** - Package.json needs backend packages
2. **Environment Configuration** - No .env.example file
3. **TypeScript Strictness** - Some components need proper typing
4. **Test Coverage** - Need unit tests alongside E2E tests
5. **Error Boundaries** - Add comprehensive error handling

### Debt Reduction Plan
- Week 3: Add all missing dependencies
- Week 4: Implement comprehensive error handling
- Week 5: Add unit test coverage
- Week 6: TypeScript strict mode migration

## 🔐 Security Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement NextAuth.js with secure session management
2. Add rate limiting to all API endpoints
3. Set up data encryption for sensitive fields
4. Implement audit logging for legal compliance

### Long-term Security Goals
1. SOC 2 Type II compliance
2. HIPAA compliance for health-related legal cases
3. End-to-end encryption for client communications
4. Zero-knowledge architecture for ultra-sensitive data

## 📈 Performance Targets

### Current Benchmarks
- Page Load: < 1.5s (target: < 1s)
- API Response: < 100ms (target: < 50ms)
- Time to Interactive: < 2s (target: < 1.5s)
